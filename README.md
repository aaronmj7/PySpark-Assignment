# PySpark-Assignment

In this assignment, you will be using PySpark to perform a series of data analysis tasks on real data, collected from Netflix. The dataset contains the weekly top 10 films and TV shows for 100 countries around the world, from July 2021 to August 2022. You are tasks with reading in the data, and extracting insights such as the most popular shows in a given country, or the number of weeks a film spent in the number 1 spot of the top 10 lists.
